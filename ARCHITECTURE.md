# Frontend Architecture â€“ Workspace Collaboration Platform

## Overview
The frontend is a modular React application designed for scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns. It supports a modern dashboard experience for workspace, team, AI, and API key management.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. **Component Modularization**
- **Dashboard sections** (Workspace header, Team, AI, API Key) are split into separate components under `dashboard/components/`.
- **Benefits:**
  - Easier to maintain and extend each section independently
  - Promotes code reuse and clarity

### 2. **State Management**
- **Local state** is managed with React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for each page/component.
- **Data fetching** is performed in the top-level page (e.g., `Detail.js`), and data/handlers are passed down as props.
- **Benefits:**
  - Keeps state close to where it is used
  - Avoids unnecessary global state complexity

### 3. **API Layer**
- All API calls are made via `fetch` using a base URL from `api.js` and environment variables.
- **Separation:** The frontend never directly accesses the database or backend logic; it communicates only via RESTful API endpoints.
- **Benefits:**
  - Decouples frontend from backend implementation
  - Easy to swap or update backend without changing frontend logic

### 4. **Role-Based UI Logic**
- The UI checks the current user's role (decoded from JWT) to determine which actions (edit, remove, invite, etc.) are available.
- **Benefits:**
  - Prevents unauthorized actions in the UI
  - Provides clear feedback to users about their permissions
  - (Security is always enforced on the backend as well)

### 5. **Routing and Navigation**
- Uses React Router for all navigation and route protection.
- OAuth and invitation flows use query parameters and redirects to preserve user context.

### 6. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Auth pages** are in `pages/auth/`.
- **Dashboard and workspace logic** are in `pages/dashboard/`.
- **Reusable UI components** are in `dashboard/components/`.
- **Benefits:**
  - Clear boundaries between authentication, dashboard, and utility logic
  - Makes onboarding and collaboration easier for new developers

### 7. **Environment Configuration**
- Uses `.env` files for API base URLs and other environment-specific settings.
- **Benefits:**
  - Easy to switch between development, staging, and production

## Why This Architecture?
- **Scalability:** New features or sections can be added as new components without affecting existing code.
- **Maintainability:** Each section/component is responsible for a single concern, making bugs easier to isolate and fix.
- **Security:** Role-based UI logic and API-only communication reduce the risk of unauthorized actions.
- **Developer Experience:** Clear structure and modularity make it easy for teams to collaborate and onboard.

## Future Improvements
- Introduce global state management (e.g., Redux, Zustand) if app complexity grows
- Add code-splitting and lazy loading for performance
- Integrate real AI and API key management features
- Add automated tests for critical components
